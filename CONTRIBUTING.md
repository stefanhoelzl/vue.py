# Contributing a PR
First of: Thanks for contributing a PR to this project!!

There a three main guidelines I try to follow in this projects:
* Write clean code according to Bob Martins book
* Have tests!!
  * Unit tests and selenium tests
  * In general I try to use the examples in the vue.js documentation as test cases to make sure vue.py works as vue.js
* Each commit needs a certain format `[type] commit message`
  * This allows a automated generation of the changelog
  * type can be one of the following
    * feature: use when adding new features
    * bugfix: use when a bug gets fixed but function stays the same
    * docs: use when updating documentation
    * internal: use when changing tooling or refactoring
